Compiled code used for Obara + Nixon-Abell et al., 2023, Nature


Each of the types of analysis in the paper use a single batch of code, which is maintained in a specific github repository, linked below.

Codes used for figure assembly, coloring, video generation, etc. are NOT maintained in these github repositories, since they are not generally applicable. You can find them instead at the following link in Figshare packaged with the data they were applied to: 



Generalized code for every other part of the paper is freely availble in the following repositories, which are complete with their own readme.txt files that will guide a user through their use:

General sptPALM and tracking code: https://github.com/cjobara/sptPALM_general

ERMCS-specific code: https://github.com/cjobara/ERMCS_specific
